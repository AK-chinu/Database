    "Ans:-MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database system. It uses a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON to store data in a way that is easily accessible and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, differ from traditional SQL databases in that they don't use a fixed schema, which means that the data doesn't need to fit into a predefined structure. Instead, they allow for a more flexible approach to data modeling and storage, making them ideal for applications that require high scalability, performance, and dynamic data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where you need to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media data, log files, and IoT data. It is also great for applications that require horizontal scalability, which means that you can easily distribute the data across multiple nodes or clusters, allowing for seamless scaling as the volume of data grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, MongoDB is well-suited for applications that require:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible data models that can adapt to changing business needs\n",
    "High scalability and availability\n",
    "High-performance read and write operations\n",
    "Real-time analytics and data processing\n",
    "Cloud-based deployment and management\n",
    "On the other hand, SQL databases are better suited for applications that require strong consistency and transactions, such as financial applications and e-commerce sites. They are also ideal for applications that rely heavily on complex queries and data relationships.\n",
